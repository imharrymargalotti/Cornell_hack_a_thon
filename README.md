### For the Team:
* The deploy directory is for code that is to be pushed to git (eventually)
* The Dev directory is for playing with
 whatever you need to for testing and implementing
* Requirements.txt is going to list all of our dependencies. 
i.e if you have have to pip install anything, add it to requirements.txt so that everyone can get it
* I Recommend making a data directory and marking it as excluded through the IDE.
This way you dont have to waste time indexing the dataset (@Jeff) while still having it be easily 
accessible. 
* environset.py is very important but git-ignored (after initial clone) so we can keep it unique.
A snippet of the file will exist in slack so we can all used the same variable names with different
values ('paths').
